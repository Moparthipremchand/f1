            <h1 class="heading">CYBER SECURITY</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. It uses a combination of technologies, processes, and best practices to defend against threats like malware, phishing, and hacking, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information and services. </p>

            <h1 class="heading">HACKING</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Hacking (also called cyber hacking) is the use of unconventional or illicit means to gain unauthorized access to a digital device, computer system or computer network. The classic example is a cybercriminal who exploits security vulnerabilities to break into a network and steal data.</p>
